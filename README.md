# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans. They wanted us to modernize their operations and achieve the most current and effective software security.
# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I think the methods I did the best in was suppressing maven vulnerabilities. I ran the report about 10 times to clear it of any unwanted false positives. It is important to code securely to maintain privacy for all customers and companies. Software security adds a level of trust in a company wellbeing.
# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you? 
The part that was the most challenging was the self-signed certificate. I had a lot of issues getting it to run the first time but because I did so much research into it, I now feel a lot more well-versed in it.
# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
The ways I increase security is by creating a more secure connection by changing to HTTPS and creating a self-signed certificate. We did a checksum verification of the cipher algorithm we implemented. We also did static testing using the maven dependency and suppressed false positive vulnerabilities.
# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used standard coding practices that have been implemented by me in several coding courses such as saving often and testing often to help keep track of where the error is at. For this case, I referred to the CWE top 25 most dangerous software weaknesses to know what similar mistakes to avoid.
# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show future employers my final project to encompass all the tools that I was taught in this class and how I managed to bring them all together for one final project.
